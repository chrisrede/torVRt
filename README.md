# torVRt
VR training Application for Soccergoalies in Unity

The project “torVRt” was created by four students of the University of Applied Sciences
Cologne in collaboration with the German Sport University Cologne and the youth team of
1.FC Köln .

“torVRt” aims to develop a virtual reality environment in which a football goalkeeping
scenario is simulated, where the user is able to track his/her motion data. This data is then
saved in a generic file format for later analysis. The simulation is adjusted particularly to
trained athletics and therefore can be used to trace training progress. Furthermore the user
is being provided with reality-simulating visuals, physics and haptics for extra immersion.
